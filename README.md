## Introduction
This repository contains an AI-based platform designed to classify **Land Use and Land Cover (LULC)** from **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery**. The platform is developed as part of the [Hack4Earth Hackathon](https://hack4earth.org), focusing on sustainable environmental solutions through AI. **OptiLand-Ai** is an AI-powered web application for LULC prediction using satellite imagery. The app allows users to select a province, view satellite imagery, and predict LULC classes while also calculating the CO‚ÇÇ impact based on different land covers. This tool is particularly useful for environmental monitoring and sustainability analysis.

## Features
- **LULC Prediction**: Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model to predict various LULC classes such as forests, residential areas, industrial areas, and more.
- **Satellite Image Visualization**: Displays satellite imagery of selected provinces with overlaid predictions using Folium.
- **CO‚ÇÇ Impact Calculation**: Estimates the total CO‚ÇÇ impact based on the predicted land use classes.
- **Interactive Map**: Integrates Folium and Streamlit for an interactive experience, including map layers and LULC class legends.
- **Class Distribution**: Visualizes the distribution of predicted LULC classes through a bar chart, breaking down their CO‚ÇÇ impact.

### Application Workflow
1. **Select a Province**: Use the sidebar to choose one of the available provinces (e.g., Tunis, Monastir).
2. **View Satellite Imagery**: The app will load and display satellite images for the selected province.
3. **LULC Prediction**: The app automatically generates grid tiles over the selected region and predicts LULC classes for each tile.
4. **CO‚ÇÇ Calculation**: Optionally, click the "Calculate CO‚ÇÇ" button to estimate the CO‚ÇÇ impact of the predicted land classes.

### LULC Classes and CO‚ÇÇ Impact Rates

| Forest                 | Forest Green     | -20                |
| HerbaceousVegetation    | Yellow Green     | -5                 |
| Highway                | Gray             | 10                 |
| Industrial             | Red              | 50                 |
| Pasture                | Medium Sea Green  | 1.5               |
| PermanentCrop          | Chartreuse       | -3                 |
| Residential            | Magenta          | 15                 |
| River                  | Dodger Blue      | 0                  |
| SeaLake                | Blue             | 0                  |

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study is the EuroSAT dataset, which contains 27,000 labeled 64x64 pixel Sentinel-2 satellite image patches across 10 different Land Use Land Cover (LULC) categories: 'AnnualCrop', 'Forest', 'HerbaceousVegetation', 'Highway', 'Industrial', 'Pasture', 'PermanentCrop', 'Residential', 'River', and 'SeaLake'. Both RGB and multi-spectral (MS) images are available for download. For our project, we will focus on RGB image classification.
